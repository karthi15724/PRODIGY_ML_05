# Food Recognition & Calorie Estimation 🍎🍔

This project is part of the **Prodigy InfoTech Machine Learning Internship (Task-05)**.

The objective of this task is to build a model that can recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie information.

---

## 📌 Task Objective
To classify food images using a deep learning model and demonstrate how such systems can help users track dietary intake.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

---

## 📊 Dataset
Food-101 Dataset (Kaggle)

---

## 🔍 Approach
1. Loaded a pre-trained food classification model
2. Preprocessed food images
3. Performed food item prediction
4. Visualized prediction results
